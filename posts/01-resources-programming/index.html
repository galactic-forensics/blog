It is generally advisable to leave such repetitive things that can be automated to the computer. Here we have a look at tools that might help with this task.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p>First things first: this is by no means going to be a comprehensive article, but will rather be my own, fairly biased view, which heavily focuses on <a href=https://www.python.org/><code>python</code></a> and <a href=https://git-scm.com/><code>git</code></a>. It hopefully starts simple, and then gets more advanced fast.<h2 id=python><a aria-label="Anchor link for: python" class=zola-anchor href=#python>Python</a></h2><p>Python is a scripted computer language that allows you to do many scientific tasks, e.g., data evaluation, automatically. It is a fairly simple language to learn, and you can get going fast, however, be open to learn more advanced techniques later on. This means: Never stop learning! Python has many advanced capabilities that can make your life easier and faster.<h3 id=learning-python><a aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-python" class=zola-anchor href=#learning-python>Learning Python</a></h3><p><a href=https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>Software Carpentry</a> has two great lessons on <code>python</code>, which are especially suited for beginners. These lessons should give you an introduction and overview of the language, but also teach you how to plot figures using <code>matplotlib</code>.<p>A great book to introduce you python was written by Allen Downy and can be found <a href=https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/>here</a>. It is available for free. The book gives an in-depth introduction into <code>python</code>, but also into the basics behind the language. Such knowledge is always helpful later on, since it gives you a deeper understanding of certain behavior.<h3 id=working-with-python><a aria-label="Anchor link for: working-with-python" class=zola-anchor href=#working-with-python>Working with Python</a></h3><p>The official <code>python</code> distribution is distributed from <a href=https://www.python.org>python.org</a>. If you install this distribution, you can add further packages using <a href=https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/><code>pip</code></a>. However, this is not always the most straight forward way to work with <code>python</code>.<h4 id=virtual-environments><a aria-label="Anchor link for: virtual-environments" class=zola-anchor href=#virtual-environments>Virtual environments</a></h4><p>Virtual environments should be considered for all your projects. Depending on what <code>python</code> environment you are using, these environments will be created different. It is worth looking into it.<h4 id=anaconda><a aria-label="Anchor link for: anaconda" class=zola-anchor href=#anaconda>Anaconda</a></h4><p>For data processing and scientific python, check out <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>Anaconda</a>. This gives you a <code>conda</code> environment for <code>python</code>. Furthermore, Anaconda comes with many packages pre-installed and has a graphical manager to handle your distribution. This can be advantageous, depending on what you need.<h4 id=pyenv><a aria-label="Anchor link for: pyenv" class=zola-anchor href=#pyenv><code>pyenv</code></a></h4><p>If you need to handle multiple different python versions and want to easily manage virtual environments, check out <a href=https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv><code>pyenv</code></a>.<h4 id=jupyter><a aria-label="Anchor link for: jupyter" class=zola-anchor href=#jupyter>Jupyter</a></h4><p>Finally, Jupyter Notebooks give a straight forward interface to <code>python</code> that allow you to play and develop code in a browser, as well as to document it in <a href=https://www.markdownguide.org/>Markdown</a>. Googles flavor of Jupyter is called <a href=https://colab.research.google.com/>Google Collab</a> and run on the web. JetBrains, the creator of PyCharm, also has an online Jupyter Notebook Server with is especially great for developing at the same time. It is called <a href=https://datalore.jetbrains.com/>Datalore</a>.<p>For Astrophysics, especially if you are interested in <a href=https://nugrid.github.io/>NuGrid</a> data, check out the <a href=https://astrohub.uvic.ca/>Astrohub</a>. You can log into the public outreach server with your GitHub account and then use a JupyterLab environment to run your astrophysics models.<h4 id=editors><a aria-label="Anchor link for: editors" class=zola-anchor href=#editors>Editors</a></h4><p>Many good python editors exist. Personally, I prefer <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>PyCharm</a>, however, many other options. PyCharm is a fully integrated developer environment (IDE) and comes with many more tools than you need in the beginning, it can therefore be overwhelming at first.<p>Other notable editors are <a href=https://www.spyder-ide.org/>Spyder</a>, which is a full IDE that comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Also notable is <a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/>Sublime Text</a>, which works in my workflow especially well for scripting. <a href=https://www.tabnine.com/blog/python-on-sublime-text/>Here</a> is a great article on how to set up Sublime Text for python.<h3 id=guis><a aria-label="Anchor link for: guis" class=zola-anchor href=#guis>GUIs</a></h3><p>If you are interested in creating graphical user interfaces for your programs, it is worth looking into GUIs. Two potential GUI creation packages that you might want to consider using are <a href=https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro/><code>PyQt</code></a> or <a href=https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2><code>PySide</code></a>. Great tutorials on Qt can be found <a href=https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/>here</a>.<p>If you want to package your GUIs with installers, check out <a href=https://build-system.fman.io/><code>fbs</code></a>. Note that the open / free version only supports <code>python-3.6</code> and is restricted to <code>PyQt5</code>. If you want to dabble with the pro version, let me know.<h3 id=advanced-python><a aria-label="Anchor link for: advanced-python" class=zola-anchor href=#advanced-python>Advanced Python</a></h3><h4 id=auto-formatting><a aria-label="Anchor link for: auto-formatting" class=zola-anchor href=#auto-formatting>Auto-formatting</a></h4><p>Formatting <code>python</code> code should adhere - for readability - to certain rules. These are often also referred as linting requirements. While it is tedious to format code by hand, automatic formatters are very helpful. I generally use <a href=https://github.com/psf/black><code>black</code></a> to format my <code>python</code> code. The beauty of this is that it there are not many possibilities to format your code, therefore, most of the decisions are already made, and it always looks awesome. Various plugins exist that can be used in editors and IDEs. <a href=https://www.duckduckgo.com>Search engines</a> are useful to find them.<h4 id=test-your-code><a aria-label="Anchor link for: test-your-code" class=zola-anchor href=#test-your-code>Test your code!</a></h4><p>Testing of code is crucial, since you generally want to make sure that your scripts, functions, classes, etc., do what you want them to do. An amazing package to test your python code is <a href=https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/><code>pytest</code></a>. If you are interested in learning testing with python, check out Brian Okken's book <a href=https://pythontest.com/pytest-book/>here</a>.<h2 id=git><a aria-label="Anchor link for: git" class=zola-anchor href=#git>Git</a></h2><p>When working with code, version control should be an integral part of your workflow. One way of controlling versions is with <code>git</code>. The Galactic Forensics Laboratory has its <code>git</code> repositories hosted <a href=https://github.com/galactic-forensics>here on GitHub</a>. Lab members get access to all repositories of the lab.<h3 id=learning-git><a aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-git" class=zola-anchor href=#learning-git>Learning <code>git</code></a></h3><p>The best way to learn <code>git</code> and / or to review your skill is by going through <a href=https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>this course on Software Carpentry</a>. The next step is then to use <code>git</code> and, if you want to keep your repos online, a service such as <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a>. You can also browse the <code>git</code> book, which is available for free <a href=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>here</a>.<p>The beauty of <code>git</code> is that you can most of the time go back in time if you made a mistake. So don't worry if something happens! A good resource for these weird cases is <a href=https://dangitgit.com/>Dangit Git</a>.<h3 id=good-practices><a aria-label="Anchor link for: good-practices" class=zola-anchor href=#good-practices>Good practices</a></h3><p>If you want to contribute code to a repository of which you are not a maintainer, you should fork the repository to your own GitHub account. Then create a branch with an appropriate name for the feature you want to contribute. Add your changes, push your branch to your fork, and then create a pull request where you describe what you have changed and why. Keep it short, but descriptive.<p>Most projects, e.g., the <a href=https://github.com/galactic-forensics/iniabu><code>iniabu</code></a> project have a developers guide that gives you additional information on how to contribute. For <code>iniabu</code>, you can find the guide, e.g., <a href=https://iniabu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/index.html>here in the docs</a>.<h3 id=advanced-git-and-github><a aria-label="Anchor link for: advanced-git-and-github" class=zola-anchor href=#advanced-git-and-github>Advanced <code>git</code> and GitHub</a></h3><h4 id=pre-commit><a aria-label="Anchor link for: pre-commit" class=zola-anchor href=#pre-commit><code>pre-commit</code></a></h4><p>If you are using <code>git</code> regularly, especially on public projects, <code>pre-commit</code> can help you to automate tasks. You can install so-called <code>hooks</code> that help you perform various tasks, e.g., formatting, etc. Check out the <a href=https://pre-commit.com/><code>pre-commit</code> website</a>.<h4 id=github-actions><a aria-label="Anchor link for: github-actions" class=zola-anchor href=#github-actions>GitHub Actions</a></h4><p>For automatic testing on GitHub, consider using <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a>. These actions can especially help when using continuous integration (CI).<h2 id=some-more-advanced-resources><a aria-label="Anchor link for: some-more-advanced-resources" class=zola-anchor href=#some-more-advanced-resources>Some more advanced resources</a></h2><h3 id=code-coverage><a aria-label="Anchor link for: code-coverage" class=zola-anchor href=#code-coverage>Code coverage</a></h3><p>When testing your python code, it is useful to know how many lines of your code are actually tested by your test suite. To automate this process, you can, e.g., use GitHub hooks for <a href=https://coveralls.io/><code>coveralls</code></a>.<h3 id=documentation><a aria-label="Anchor link for: documentation" class=zola-anchor href=#documentation>Documentation</a></h3><p>Last, but surely not least, you will likely make extensive use of great documentations that you can find online. For <code>python</code> code, automatic documentation using your doc strings can be really helpful. One tool to do so is <a href=https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/><code>sphinx</code></a>. This is especially powerful in combination with <a href=https://readthedocs.org/>ReadTheDocs</a>, which can also be implemented with a GitHub hook.<h3 id=hypermodern-python><a aria-label="Anchor link for: hypermodern-python" class=zola-anchor href=#hypermodern-python>Hypermodern Python</a></h3><p>Finally, if you want to code in <code>python</code> using many bells and whistles, check out the blog articles on hypermodern python by Claudio Jolowicz. The series can be found <a href=https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/>here</a>, the first article <a href=https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/>here</a>.</section></article></main></div>
